![Application GIF](TourOfHeroesGif.gif)
# App was roughly finished in 4 days:
    Day 1. 
        - Setup the app
        - Created main components
        - Making the heroes component display a list of mock heroes
    Day 2.
        - Created hero details component which shows the details of a hero when clicked(displayed under the content of the heroes list in the heroes component)
        - Adding hero and message services. Hero service is intended to keep all methods that make changes to the heroes list while message service is generating messages when an         action occurs.
    Day 3.
        - Add navigation to the application(Dashboard, Heroes). Dashboard brings out top players, Heroes brings out a list of all heroes. 
        - Added more detailed CSS(still pretty basic).
        - Routed the navigation.
    Day 4.
        - Simulated a data server with InMemoryWebApiModule so I can simulate basic CRUD operations.
        - Added more CSS.
